She'd rather be on TikTok than helping sell trees, but hey—he's trying. Twelve days till Christmas. Twelve chances to get it right. And every day brings something new: a tree thief, a viral moment, some messy customers, and this fine coffee shop owner across the street named Ava. She's not impressed by Marcus, but the chemistry? Baby, it's thick like eggnog. At the heart of it all is Marcus learning how to show up—for his daughter, his community, and maybe, just maybe, for himself again.</p>

                        <h2>ABOUT THE FILMMAKER</h2>
                        <p>I'm a script-slinging storyteller with a Southern soul — part Shonda, part Spike, part Santa Claus. From gritty crime dramas set in Atlanta's underworld to heartwarming holiday comedies featuring viral TikToks and dollar-store wreaths, I navigate genres like a showrunner in sneakers. I craft worlds where FBI agents clash with cartel bosses, artists lead double lives, and Grandma might just become the next social media sensation. With a producer's mind, a writer's wit, and a director's eye for both tension and tenderness, my scripts are not just narratives but living, breathing embodiments of culture, conflict, and comedy.</p>
                        
                        <p>Every project, whether it's The Line, Granny's House, LifeArt, or The Twelve Dates of Christmas Tree Lot, pulses with purpose. I've been fortunate to contribute to over 30 projects and 186 episodes of "One Tree Hill", honing skills in creativity, leadership, critical thinking, problem-solving, time management, and multitasking. My knack for clear communication has been instrumental in bridging the gap between producers and department heads, ensuring seamless production workflows.</p>
